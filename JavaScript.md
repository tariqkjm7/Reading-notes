# Java Script
**JavaScript (JS):** is a lightweight, interpreted or compiled in time programming language with first-class functionality. Although the most well-known language is the scripting language for web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a dynamic, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language that supports object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles (such as functional programming).

This section is for the JavaScript language itself, not the parts for web pages or other host environments. For information on the API specification for web pages,

## JavaScript IDs:

**JavaScript IDs:**
All JavaScript variables must be specified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (such as x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, total size).
The general rules for creating names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

* Names can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and dollar signs.
* Names must begin with a letter.
* Names can also start with $ and _ (but we won't use them in this tutorial).
* Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
Reserved words (such as JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as nouns.
