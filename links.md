# HTML LINKS 
Links are created using the **(a)** element. Users can click on anything between the opening **(a)** tag and the closing **(/a)** tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

The text between the opening **(a)** tag and closing **(/a)** tag is known as link text. Where possible, your link text should explain where visitors will be taken if they click on it (rather than just saying "click here"). Below you can see the link to IMDB that was created on the previous page.  Many people navigate websites by scanning the text for links. Clear link text can help visitors find what they want.  This will give them a more positive impression of your site and may encourage them to visit it for longer.  (It also helps people using screen reader software.)To write good link text, you can think of words people might use when searching for the page that you are linking to. **(For example, rather than write "places to stay" you could use something more specific such as "hotels in New York.")**



## Linking to other sites


**(a)** Links are created using the **(a)** element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.Users can click on anything that appears between the opening **(a)** tag and the closing **(/a)** tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute.When you link to a different website, the value of the hrefattribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an absolute URL.Browsers show links in blue with an underline by default  ðŸ˜ƒ 


## Linking to other PAges on the sAme site

When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value of the href attribute is just the name of the file.If you have different pages of a site in different folders, then you can use a slightly more complex syntax to indicate where the page is in relation to the current page. You will learn more about these on the pages 81-84.If you look at the download code for each chapter, you will see that the index.html file contains links that use relative URLs. **see this** [reading notes](https://tariqkjm7.github.io/Reading-notes/HTML&CSS)
