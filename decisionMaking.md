# Looking at How other Sites are built

When the web was first taking off, one of the most common ways to learn about HTML and discover new tips and techniques was to look at the source code that made up web pages.These days there are many more books and online tutorials that teach HTML, but you can still look at the code that a web server sends to you. To try this out for yourself, simply go to the sample code for this chapter, [at htm land css book](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/) and click on the link called "View Source."Once you have opened this page, you can look for the Viewmenu in your browser, and select the option that says Source or View source. (The title changes depending on what browser you are using.)You should see a new window appear, and it will contain the source code that was used to create this page.You can see this result in the photograph on the right. The page you see is the window at the top; the code is below   At first this code might look complicated but don't be discouraged. By the time you have finished the next chapter of this book, you will be able to understand it. All of the examples for this book are on the website, and you can use this simple technique on any of the example pages to see how they work. You can also download all of the code for this book from the same website by clicking on the "Download" link.

## SummaryStructure 

* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled Xbrackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes Xthe start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more Xabout the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value. 
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are Xavailable for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

### markup

**Structural markup:** the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.

**Semantic markup:** which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on.


# decision making 

There are often **several** places in a script where decisions are made that 
determine which lines of code should be run next. Flowcharts can help 
you plan for these occasions.
