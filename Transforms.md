# Transforms

With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

## Transform SyntaxThe 

actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

## 2D Transforms

Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. We’ll start by discussing how to [transform elements](http://www.css3files.com/transform/) on a two-dimensional plane, and then work our way into three-dimensional transforms.


### **ex::**
**.box-1 {**

  **transform: scale(.75);**

**}**

**.box-2 {**

  **transform: scale(1.25);**

**}**


## CSS3
 has introduced countless possibilities for UX designers, and the best thing about them is that the coolest parts are really simple to implement.

 Just a couple of lines of code will give you an awesome transition effect that will excite your users, increase engagement and ultimately, when used well, increase your conversions.

* **Fade in**

Having things fade in is a fairly common request from clients. It’s a great way to emphasize functionality or draw attention to a call to action.

* **Change color**

Animating a change of color used to be unbelievably complex, with all kinds of math involved in calculating separate RGB values and then recombining them



*  **Grow & Shrink**

To grow an element, you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding. But now we can use CSS3’s transform to enlarge.
