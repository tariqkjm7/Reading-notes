## my point of view in the growth mindset

In short, a growth mindset is the adoption of a new way of thinking filled with intellectual growth Which means setting appropriate standards and requirements for each of life's challenges, which means investing the mind in developing appropriate plans to face any idea or a new challenge. This is exactly what we mean when we talk about a growth mindset.Â ðŸ§ 

On the other hand

There is such a thing as a fixed mindset, In short, this means the complete belief that intelligence and positive thinking are among the fixed qualities that are born with a person in a different way Which drives the owners of this method to think about failure and not put the effort and time needed to face any challenge and give up quickly. And here is a simple diagram that explains the differences between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset.Â ðŸ’¥:
