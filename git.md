# git
Git is a free and open-source distributed version system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects quickly and efficiently.
Git relies on distributed software development where over one developer can access the ASCII text file of a selected application and may modify changes that other developers might even see. It allows the user to possess "versions" of the project, which show changes made to the code over time and allows the user to undo if necessary and undo those changes.

## git features
- Distributed System:   
***Distributed systems are those which allow the users to perform work on a project from all over the world.*** A distributed system holds a Central repository that can be accessed by many remote collaborators by using a Version Control System.
- Compatibility: Git is ***compatible with all the Operating Systems that are being used these days.*** Git repositories can also access the repositories of other Version Control Systems like SVN, CVK, etc. Git can directly access the remote repositories created by these SVNs.
- Non-linear Development:
***Git allows users from all over the world to perform operations on a project remotely.*** A user can pick up any part of the project and do the required operation and then further update the project. This can be done by the Non-linear development behavior of the Git
- Branching:*** Git allows its users to work on a line that runs parallel to the main project files.*** These lines are called branches. Branches in Git provide a feature to make changes in the project without affecting the original version.
