# React&Forms 


HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.

## Controlled Components


In HTML, form elements such as **(input)**, **(textArea)** and **(select)** typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with **setState().**

## The Conditional

## The if statement
Using a conditional, like an if statement, allows us to specify that a certain block of code should be executed if a certain condition is met.


## ternary operator:

**Here‚Äôs what you need to know:**
* The **condition** is what you‚Äôre actually testing. The result of your condition should be **true ‚úî** or **false‚ùå** or at least coerce to either **boolean value** üëç.

* A **‚ùì** separates our **conditional** from our true value. Anything between the ‚ùì and the : is what is executed if the **condition** evaluates to true.
* Finally a **‚Åö** colon. If your **condition** evaluates to false, any code after the colon is executed
