# wireFrame
I’ve split this article into three sections. First of all, there’s a general introduction to wireframes and the tools used to create them, then there’s a step-by-step guide to creating them, and finally a few key principles to keep in mind when wireframing. If you’re short on time, simply select the section that interests you most in the menu below.
## The best tools for wireframing
There are heaps of [free tools](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/free-wireframing-tools/)  out there for creating wireframes and prototypes, so you should experiment with as many as you can to find the ones that suit you the best. Don’t forget that [you can also just use pen and paper](https://blog.prototypr.io/how-paper-wireframing-will-make-you-a-better-designer-5a57db8dca13)!
