# HTML & CSS
## HTML 
 **HTML**
We will spend the first chapter looking at how HTML is used to create web pages. You will see that you start by writing down the words you want to appear on your page. You then add tags or elements to the words so that the browser knows what is a heading, where a paragraph begins and ends, and so on. The rest of this section introduces the tags you have at your disposal to create web pages, grouped into chapters on:
* text
* lists 
* links 
* images 
* tables

forms, video audio and flash, and miscellaneous elements. I should warn you that the examples in the first nine chapters are not exciting to look
at, yet they are the foundation of every web page. The following
chapters on CSS will show you how to make your pages look a
lot more interesting.
